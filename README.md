To run this code you need to download:
- tkinter: run in the command window "pip install tk"
- pydicom: run in the command window "pip install pydicom"
Then, WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING run the code directly. A user interface will pop-up asking for the DICOM folder to be opened.
Each slice will appear sequentially as Figure1 is closed.
